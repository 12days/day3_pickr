Project 3: Prayer Wall
======================

> As always, we start the day with user stories. We keep it simple.

* As a user, I want to be able to upload my photos and delete them (paperclip gem)
* As a user, I want to see a livestream of recent uploads
* As a user, I want to see a stream of my friends uploads
* As a user, Iâ€™m a pirate (just a fun theme we decided to use for the day)

### Gems ###

* [Paperclip for uploading images](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip)
